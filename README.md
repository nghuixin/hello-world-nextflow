# Greetings Workflow Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a Nextflow workflow designed for processing greeting messages. The workflow includes two primary processes: `sayHello` and `toUpper`. It reads greetings and language codes from specified input files, creates greeting messages, and then converts these messages to uppercase.

## Prerequisites
- Nextflow (20.10.0 or later)
- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, etc.)

## File Structure
- `main.nf`: The main Nextflow script containing the workflow.
- `params.input_file`: Text file with greeting messages, one per line.
- `params.lang_file`: Text file with language codes corresponding to each greeting.

## Processes
1. **sayHello**: Takes greetings and language codes to generate text files named `<language code>-output.txt`.
2. **toUpper**: Converts the text inside the files generated by `sayHello` to uppercase, saving them as `upper-<original file name>`.

## Usage
To run the workflow, make sure you have the input files `params.input_file` and `params.lang_file` set up with your desired content. Then, execute the following command:


```nextflow run hello-world.nf```
